This is the unpacked contents of https://packages.debian.org/sid/openjdk-17-doc but 
we assume it should be the same across Debian version.

CAUTION: generate_java_tooltips.py does not generate Tier 3 content - it only does tier 1 and tier 2. We can 
take the HTML files contained in the above .deb file without any processing and propagate through our pipeline.

Most of the interesting files are under the "api" folder.
