     Why Kotlin/Native?

    <p id="z1tx07p_9">
     Kotlin/Native is primarily designed to allow compilation for platforms on which
     <span class="emphasis" id="z1tx07p_12">
      virtual machines
     </span>
     are not desirable or possible, such as embedded devices or iOS. It's ideal for situations when you need to to produce a self-contained program that doesn't require an additional runtime or a virtual machine.
    </p>
    <p id="z1tx07p_10">
     It's easy to include compiled Kotlin code in existing projects written in C, C++, Swift, Objective-C, and other languages. You can also use existing native code, static or dynamic C libraries, Swift/Objective-C frameworks, graphical engines, and anything else directly from Kotlin/Native.
