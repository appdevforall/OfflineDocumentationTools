      Keeping the Language Modern

     . We recognize that systems accumulate legacy over time. What was once been cutting-edge technology can become hopelessly outdated today. We have to evolve the language to keep it relevant to the needs of our users and up-to-date with their expectations. This includes not only adding new features, but also phasing out old ones that are no longer recommended for production use and have become legacy.

     <span class="emphasis" id="el2p7z_32">
      before the change happens
     </span>
     . By the time the language changes we want most of the code in the world to be already updated and thus have no issues migrating to the new version.

     . Going through deprecation cycles requires significant effort, so we want to minimize the number of incompatible changes we'll be making in the future. Apart from using our best judgement, we believe that trying things out in real life is the best way to validate a design. Before casting things in stone we want them battle-tested. This is why we use every opportunity to make early versions of our designs available in production versions of the language, but in one of the
     <span class="emphasis" id="el2p7z_34">

     statuses:

     . Such features are not stable, they can be changed at any time, and the users that opt into using them do so explicitly to indicate that they are ready to deal with the future migration issues. These users provide invaluable feedback that we gather to iterate on the design and make it rock-solid.

     Incompatible changes
    </h2>
    <p id="el2p7z_36">
     If, upon updating from one version to another, some code that used to work doesn't work anymore, it is an
     <span class="emphasis" id="el2p7z_46">
      incompatible change
     </span>
     in the language (sometimes referred to as a "breaking change"). There can be debates as to what "doesn't work anymore" means precisely in some cases, but it definitely includes the following:
    </p>
    <ul class="list _bullet" id="el2p7z_37">
     <li class="list__item" id="el2p7z_47">
      <p id="el2p7z_49">
       Code that compiled and ran fine is now rejected with an error (at compile or link time). This includes removing language constructs and adding new restrictions.

     <li class="list__item" id="el2p7z_48">
      <p id="el2p7z_50">
       Code that executed normally is now throwing an exception.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p id="el2p7z_38">
     The less obvious cases that belong to the "gray area" include handling corner cases differently, throwing an exception of a different type than before, changing behavior observable only through reflection, modifying undocumented or undefined behavior, renaming binary artifacts, and others. Sometimes such changes are crucial and affect migration experience dramatically, sometimes they are insignificant.
    </p>
    <p id="el2p7z_39">
     Some examples of what definitely isn't an incompatible change include:
    </p>
    <ul class="list _bullet" id="el2p7z_40">
     <li class="list__item" id="el2p7z_51">

     The principles of Keeping the Language Modern and Comfortable Updates suggest that incompatible changes are sometimes necessary, but they should be introduced carefully. Our goal is to make users aware of upcoming changes well in advance to let them migrate their code comfortably.
    </p>
    <p id="el2p7z_42">
     Ideally, every incompatible change should be announced through a compile-time warning reported in the problematic code (usually referred to as a
     <span class="emphasis" id="el2p7z_57">
      deprecation warning
     </span>
     ) and accompanied by automated migration aids. So, the ideal migration workflow is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul class="list _bullet" id="el2p7z_43">
     <li class="list__item" id="el2p7z_58">
      <p id="el2p7z_60">
       Update to version A (where the change is announced)
      </p>

       <li class="list__item" id="el2p7z_62">
        <p id="el2p7z_64">
         See warnings about the upcoming change
        </p>
       </li>
       <li class="list__item" id="el2p7z_63">
        <p id="el2p7z_65">
         Migrate the code with help from tools
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li class="list__item" id="el2p7z_59">
      <p id="el2p7z_66">
       Update to version B (where the change happens)
      </p>
      <ul class="list _bullet" id="el2p7z_67">
       <li class="list__item" id="el2p7z_68">
        <p id="el2p7z_69">
         See no issues at all
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p id="el2p7z_44">
     In practice, some changes can't be accurately detected at compile time, so no warnings can be reported, but at least the users will be notified through the release notes of version A that a change is coming in version B.

      Dealing with compiler bugs
     </h3>
     <p id="el2p7z_70">
      Compilers are complicated software, and despite the best efforts of their developers, they have bugs. The bugs that cause the compiler itself to fail or report spurious errors or generate obviously failing code, though annoying and often embarrassing, are easy to fix, because the fixes do not constitute incompatible changes. Other bugs may cause the compiler to generate incorrect code that does not fail: for example, by missing some errors in the source or simply generating the wrong instructions. Fixes for such bugs are technically incompatible changes (some code used to compile fine, but now it won't anymore), but we are inclined to fix them as soon as possible to prevent the bad code patterns from spreading across user code. In our opinion, this supports the principle of Comfortable Updates, because fewer users have a chance of encountering the issue. Of course, this applies only to bugs that are found soon after appearing in a released version.

EAPs of language releases usually produce binaries that will be later rejected by the stable compiler to make sure that possible bugs in the binary format survive no longer than the preview period. Final Release Candidates normally do not bear this limitation.

     Ideally, a new version of a library can be used as a "drop-in replacement" for an older version. This means that upgrading a binary dependency should not break anything, even if the application is not recompiled (this is possible under dynamic linking).
    </p>

    <p id="el2p7z_121">
     On the other hand, a lot depends on the library authors being careful about which changes are safe to make. Thus, it's crucial that library authors understand how source changes affect compatibility and follow certain best practices to keep both APIs and ABIs of their libraries stable. Here are some assumptions that we make when considering language changes from the library evolution standpoint:

       Library code should always specify return types of public/protected functions and properties explicitly, thus never relying on type inference for public API. Subtle changes in type inference may cause return types to change inadvertently, leading to binary compatibility issues.

     </li>
     <li class="list__item" id="el2p7z_128">
      <p id="el2p7z_130">
       Overloaded functions and properties provided by the same library should do essentially the same thing. Changes in type inference may result in more precise static types to be known at call sites, causing changes in overload resolution.

     Command line options accepted by the compiler are also a kind of public API, and they are subject to the same considerations. Supported options (those that don't have the "-X" or "-XX" prefix) can be added only in language releases and should be properly deprecated before removing them. The "-X" and "-XX" options are experimental and can be added and removed at any time.

     As legacy features get removed and bugs fixed, the source language changes, and old code that has not been properly migrated may not compile anymore. The normal deprecation cycle allows a comfortable period of time for migration, and even when it's over and the change ships in a stable version, there's still a way to compile non-migrated code.

      Evolving the binary format
     </h3>
     <p id="el2p7z_149">
      Unlike sources that can be fixed by hand in the worst case, binaries are a lot harder to migrate, and this makes backwards compatibility crucial in the case of binaries. Incompatible changes to binaries can make updates very uncomfortable and thus should be introduced with even more care than those in the source language syntax.
     </p>
     <p id="el2p7z_150">
      For fully stable versions of the compiler, the default binary compatibility protocol is the following:
     </p>
     <ul class="list _bullet" id="el2p7z_151">
      <li class="list__item" id="el2p7z_155">
       <p id="el2p7z_158">
        All binaries are backwards compatible; that means a newer compiler can read older binaries (for example, 1.3 understands 1.0 through 1.2).
       </p>
      </li>
      <li class="list__item" id="el2p7z_156">
       <p id="el2p7z_159">
        Older compilers reject binaries that rely on new features (for example, the 1.0 compiler rejects binaries that use coroutines).
       </p>
      </li>
      <li class="list__item" id="el2p7z_157">
       <p id="el2p7z_160">
        Preferably (but we can't guarantee it), the binary format is mostly forwards compatible with the next language release, but not later ones (in the cases when new features are not used, for example, 1.9 can understand most binaries from 2.0, but not 2.1).
       </p>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p id="el2p7z_152">
      This protocol is designed for comfortable updates as no project can be blocked from updating its dependencies even if it's using a slightly outdated compiler.
     </p>
     <p id="el2p7z_153">
      Note that not all target platforms have reached this level of stability, but Kotlin/JVM has.
