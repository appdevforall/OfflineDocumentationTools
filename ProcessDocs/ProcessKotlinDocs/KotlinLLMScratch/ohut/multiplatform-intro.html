     Kotlin Multiplatform allows you to share code across different platforms, whether it's mobile, web, or desktop. The platforms to which the code is compiled are defined by the list of
     <span class="emphasis" id="h2m6d5_19">
      targets
     </span>
     .
    </p>
    <p id="h2m6d5_14">
     Each target has a corresponding
     <span class="emphasis" id="h2m6d5_20">
      source set
     </span>
     which represents a set of source files with its own dependencies and compiler options. Platform-specific source sets, for example
     <code class="code" id="h2m6d5_21">
      jvmMain
     </code>
     for the JVM, can make use of platform-specific libraries and APIs.
    </p>
    <p id="h2m6d5_15">
     To share code among a subset of targets, intermediate source sets are used. For example, the
     <code class="code" id="h2m6d5_22">
      appleMain
     </code>
     source set represents the code shared among all Apple platforms. The code shared among all platforms and compiled to all declared targets has its own source set,
     <code class="code" id="h2m6d5_23">
      commonMain
     </code>
     . It cannot use platform-specific APIs, but can take advantage of multiplatform libraries.
    </p>
    <p id="h2m6d5_16">
     When compiling for a specific target, Kotlin combines the common source set, the relevant intermediate source sets, and the target-specific source set.

    <p id="h2m6d5_30">
     It's sometimes more convenient to share code among a subset of similar targets. Kotlin Multiplatform provides a way to simplify their creation with a
     <span class="emphasis" id="h2m6d5_34">
      default hierarchy template
     </span>
     . It includes a pre-defined list of intermediate source sets that are created based on the targets you specified in your project.
    </p>
    <p id="h2m6d5_31">
     To access platform-specific APIs from shared code, you can use another Kotlin mechanism,
     <span class="emphasis" id="h2m6d5_35">
      expected and actual declarations
     </span>
     . This way, you can declare that you
     <code class="code" id="h2m6d5_36">
      expect
     </code>
     a platform-specific API in common code but provide a separate
     <code class="code" id="h2m6d5_37">
      actual
     </code>
     implementation for each target platform. You can use this mechanism with different Kotlin concepts, including functions, classes, and interfaces. For example, you can define a function in common code, but provide its implementation using a platform-specific library in a corresponding source set.

    <p id="h2m6d5_47">
     A Kotlin Multiplatform project can depend on external libraries and other multiplatform projects. For common code, you can add dependencies on multiplatform libraries in the common source set. Kotlin automatically resolves and adds the appropriate platform-specific parts to other source sets. If only a platform-specific API is required, add the dependency to the corresponding source sets.
    </p>
    <p id="h2m6d5_48">
     Adding Android-specific dependencies to a Kotlin Multiplatform project is similar to adding them in a pure Android project. When working with iOS-specific dependencies, you can seamlessly integrate Apple SDK frameworks without extra configuration. For external libraries and frameworks, Kotlin offers interoperability with Objective-C and Swift.
