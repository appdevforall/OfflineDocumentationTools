     You often need to create several native targets that could potentially reuse a lot of the common logic and third-party APIs.
    </p>
    <p id="-hx2a0r_35">
     For example, in a typical multiplatform project targeting iOS, there are two iOS-related targets: one is for iOS ARM64 devices, the other is for the x64 simulator. They have separate platform-specific source sets, but in practice there is rarely a need for different code for the device and simulator, and their dependencies are much the same. So iOS-specific code could be shared between them.
    </p>
    <p id="-hx2a0r_36">
     Evidently, in this setup it would be desirable to have a shared source set for two iOS targets, with Kotlin/Native code that could still directly call any of the APIs that are common to both the iOS device and the simulator.

     In this case, you can share code across native targets in your project using the
